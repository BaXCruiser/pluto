# Pluto
Pluto aims to provide seemless voice channeling from your phone to PC. It aims to channel audio stream from your phone to PC through a secure and simple connection.

## Motivations
As a lazy developer, I know the struggle of disconnecting your earphones from your laptop to your phone because you're getting a call or a video message or even some random reddit or insta video that you might wanna turn the audio on for(I am not a normie). Or maybe you just like the feel of not having to ever unplug your earphones from your PC. Pluto is all you'll need.

## Current scope
Initial basic scope are listed below
- A mobile and PC app for the platforms to communicate. 
- A secure, reliable and fast audio streaming service(can use bluetooth for now).
- A configurable and easy to setup environment.

At the moment of writing this I just have a vague idea of what needs to be done. Nothing concrete but the flow is quite clear. The mobile app should be able to connect to PC automatically or manually (depending on the configuration) and stream configured audio systems to the PC(for ex. Voice calls, whatsApp calls, ringtone only etc). In case of calls the app should prompt a notification on the PC with approprate actions (receive and cut). In case of all audio streaming, there should be a easy enable button to stream all audio from phone to PC.

The current scopes only focus on audio and notifications. Please feel free to add to the current scopes and future expansion scopes.

## Colaborate
As of now there are no proper guidelines except create a wiki of the blueprint of the system and start creating issue and working on the issues. Feel free to checkout other wiki how to and create your own for the roadmap.
